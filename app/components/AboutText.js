                <p>
                    We are an online, mono-piece gallery with opening hours. Why? Becauseâ€¦
                </p>
                <h4 style={{marginTop: '32px'}}>We are for the art.</h4>
                <p>
                    We want you to experience the artwork in the moment. We want you to connect with the piece and through it connect with the artist who created it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we are only open for short periods of time. That is why we only show one piece at a time.
                </p>
                <h4 style={{marginTop: '32px'}}>We are for the artist.</h4>
                <p>
                    Every piece we show is for sale. The price includes shipping. The artist gets 100% of the profits.
